file is in eight 828-byte chunks, one per saved game; NOT the standard table format

0-15: name of the saved game, null terminated, junk occupying empty space
16-17: blank?  junk?

9x38 byte chunks per pilot, in the usual order, player last
14: last name
14: callsign
2: CODE1?
2: rank
2: missions
2: kills
2: CODE2?
  
360-391:
4:unknown, rewritten by engine after each mission
  42 9A 00 00
5: numbers of each medal type: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Golden Sun, Pewter Planet
12: ribbons obtained or not
1: Mission (index from 0)
1: Series (index from 1)
9: unknown
  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

392-427:
16: two bytes per pilot, 0 if alive, 0x0A if dead
  other values meaningful?  Time of death somehow? 0x01 also registers as KIA
4: one byte per ace, 1 if not seen, 0x0A if dead
2: date
2: year
4: unknown
  06 00 00 00
2: Promotion points
2: unknown 00 00
2: victory points
2: series

400-427: unknown, mostly zero

428-527 replaced after first mission ended in ejection, 100 bytes, seems to correspond to four nav points?
25 bytes per nav point
2C 01 96 00 05 00 00 01 00 C9 68 5A 91 00 30 75 00 00 78 EC FF 00 98 3A 00
C2 01 38 FF 0D 00 00 02 00 16 69 9A 91 00 C8 AF 00 00 10 27 00 00 E0 B1 FF
32 00 3E FE 08 00 00 03 00 63 69 DA 91 00 88 13 00 00 88 13 00 00 38 50 FF

8 is nav point number? 6 is whether the point was reached or not?

Two other bytes changed, 533 and 534 became 0xff, skipped five of what would have been the next one, maybe 6 and 7 have significance?

Mission where pilot died must be stored somewhere, I think
Same for mission where aces were seen, died?
Series count?
Last mission data?
