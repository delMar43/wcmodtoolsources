# wcmodtoolsources
Source code of "old" modding tools for the classic (320x200) Wing Commander games.
These tools have not been written by me. They have been mostly made available on the forums at www.wcnews.com
Some of those modding tools contained the source code.

The aim of making these source files available here is to preserve the (very often) elsewhere undocumented functionality. I have removed game data files from the projects and changed some file extensions from .txt to the according one.
