first four bytes are filesize, LSB first, little endian.

next is a table; entries take up four bytes each
each entry in the table points to a block at some other location in the file; three entries per camp file

first block:
Eight bytes per mission slot.  Empty slots are always 255, 255, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, but some occupied slots have those values too
Looks like four two-byte values per mission.  Not clear as to the significance.
First int is usually between 0 and 10.  SM2 they can go higher, usually between 10 and 27.
First number is background image during the mission, remaining numbers are location of image in some way?


second block:
90 bytes per series.
First ten are series information.
0: wingman
1: always 0 (may form INT with 0)
2: number of missions in series
3/4: victory points for the series (-1 if there are no victory points; can be ridiculously high for some unwinnable series)
5: in Vega is -1 for top of tree, 64 & 65 for bottom of tree, otherwise represents level of mission tree; in other campaigns there are more -1's inserted; cutscene triggers?
6: series destination if series victory
7: ship flown in next series if series victory
8: series destination if series loss
9: ship flown in next series if series loss


Remaining eighty are divided into twenty per mission slot.
0/1: medal that can be acquired
2/3: kill points required to get a medal; very large in missions where no medal is intended to be available
4-15: victory points per objective
16-19: UNKNOWN, always zero

MEDALS
0: BRONZE
1: SILVER
2: GOLD
3: SUN?
4: VALOR


third block:
This is who is in the bar before a mission
13 blocks of eight bytes
Each block of eight is a mission series
Max four missions per series, two bytes per mission, one for each seat in the bar; left first, then right

-1: Empty
0 : Spirit
1 : Hunter
2 : Bossman/Jazz
3 : Iceman
4 : Angel
5 : Paladin/Doomsday
6 : Maniac
7 : Knight

0: Hornet
1: Rapier
2: Scimitar/Dralthi
3: Raptor
