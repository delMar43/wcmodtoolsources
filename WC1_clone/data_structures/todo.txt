"Missions also award promotion points. Promotion points are earned for reaching the maximum number of victory points possible in a mission, reaching or passing a number of total kills that is divisible by five, and for killing a Kilrathi Ace or Drakhai. In some missions, you LOSE one promotion point if your wingmate dies during the mission.

Promotion points accumulate from mission to mission until they exceed a random number generated at the end of each mission. If you pass this number and are eligible for promotion, you will receive the next rank. Whether or not you are eligible for promotion, the promotion point total will also be set to zero. Note that you cannot become a Lieutenant Colonel in the Vega campaign."
