|            Wing Commander Academy - Wingmen Speech File Format          |
|                      Also used by Wing Commander 2                      |

The speech files used in both WC2 and Academy use the same format, which
makes it extremely simple to move speech files from one game to another.
However, should one be interested in including in the game custom voice
files, it is first necessary to understand how things are stored.

The way the speech files are organized, makes it very simple for people
to create their own speech files with little effort. 
It's structure is basically comprised of a header with several pointers which
point to the different voices inside the same file. Voices itself can be
extracted from simple VOC or WAV files. I'll be using VOC files through
this file.

-> First some quick info on VOC files

Since i'm not covering in detail VOC file format, i'll only tell you
what you need to know:

 - Sample Rates:
    
    Academy uses VOC data coded at 11KHz (8 bits, mono). You can create
    such files in no time using your favourite sound software.
    I used Creative Wave Studio (it comes with every SoundBlaster card)

 - VOC File Offsets:
  
    Offset 27 - Data Size (3 bytes)
    Offset 42 - First byte of Voice Data


-> Academy Speech File Format

These files can be divided in 2 basic sections: Header and Data

I found two kinds of header: a 68 byte header and a 128 byte header.
I'm covering here the 68 byte header, since it's smaller and the final 
result appears to be the same.

                                                ("Transmitting Data")

 Notes: The "3+1 bytes" means that the pointer takes 3 bytes, with 1 extra
        byte (e0h). Also, the quotes were taken from the Hobbes file, so you
        can have a pretty good idea on when the game will play these sounds.
        One last thing: the descriptions provided above is only reliable for 
        wingmen (for example, no kilrathi will ask you for help :) ). More
        details on any communic.s* file can be found on their communic.t*
        counterpart.

 |Data Info: |
  -----------

Not much to say here really... All you have to put here is the data taken
from several VOC files, beginning at offset 42 and with the lenght stored
at offsets 27/28/29, as explained in the VOC info above. 
To create a speech file from scratch, create a file with an empty header and 
keep adding to the end of the file the data from the several VOC files. 
Of course, don't forget to update the header so the pointers point to the
right offsets.


-> Future work

- The pointer at offset 36 deserves looking at closely. It contains the same
value as offset 40, so it suggests a zero byte field (as the size of n can
be calculated by subtracting pointers n+1 by n). It's my guess that it's the 
place for a death voice. This is consistent with the fact that Hobbes doesn't 
die in WC2, he always ejects. IMHO, this field is worth checking in WC2 with 
generic confed pilots (those can die :) )

- It could be interesting to check out the 128 byte header in detail later.

- Some sample C code... maybe later :)
