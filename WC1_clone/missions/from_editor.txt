Actual mission file is six blocks, not four
Block 1 is 0x600 long, 64 slots of 24 bytes each, one per mission with some extra slots
Fifth block is wing names, not sure where used
Sixth block is system names, not sure where used

First block in editor

0-1: wingman 1
2-3: wingman 2
4-5: wingman 3
6-7: wingman 4
8-9: wingman 5
ship numbers, 0xFFFF if none


Second block
77 bytes per nav point

0-29:
Nav point label

30-31:
1: dominant
0: manipulated
2-4: follow-up

32-34: x coord
36-38: y coord
40-42: z coord
NOTE: x&y coordinates have odd formatting for signing numbers, see editor code for more details
z is always positive
higher-order bytes come later

45-46
47-48
49-50
51-52
Manipulation bytes, four pairs for up to four actions
First byte defines action, 0 turns off, 1 turns on, 255 does nothing
Second byte defines target nav point
If a nav turns itself on, SM2 treats it like a stealth mission if you're flying a Dralthi; amusing hack

53-54:
